#### History
**12/1/16** - Fixed mobile menu overflow/height were causing issues, add page to github pages and still need to take photos.
**11/28/16** - Completed checklist, created loader, cleaned up code, added more additional comments, added copy to clipboard functionality for desktop, checked website on devices. Last thing to do is buy domain/hosting and take pictures for the website.
**11/20/16** - Finished mobile layout and desktop. Website about 95% done next items to do is finish loader, tweak CSS or clean it up, and sames goes for JS. Do performance tests on multiple browsers. Once finished and everything is tested buy domain/hosting.
**11/16/16** - 100vh works great in other mobile browsers, but chrome is causing a jump. To fix maybe use javascript to determine the heights on mobile? Added SVG using the <use> element creating less markup. Finished the toggle but still needs improvement tweak as you go. First thing to fix is the naming convention make it more specific. Look into the small jump on mobile chrome for the smooth scrolling or use smooth scrolling library. Also look into possibly removing the smooth scroll and using CSS :target with transitions?
**11/14/16** - almost finished the layout for mobile, fixing the descriptions and heights for the projects. After that I can continue on the next task.
**11/8/16** - tpyed out details on each project
**11/7/16** - added new view more button hover, added scroll section JS functionality, and got main theme layout finished.
**10/17/16** - Introduced WAMP, added more edits to main nav, feature proj, and figuring out the structure of the website.
**9/29/16** - Added conctact section, copyright section, added svg img border. Possibly create mockup to figure out how to layout the current website.
**9/28/16** - Completed heading/ main/ and still finish project template structure
